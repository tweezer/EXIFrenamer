# IPTCrenamer
I was searching for a tool to rename a lots of JPEG files on my Mac with Data from EXIF/IPTC Metadata. There have been a lots of tools, but no one was the solution I needed. So I took some time to write this small script in Python to do the job.

It has been written on a Mac (macOS 10.14), but I think it should work on other Unix, BSD and Linux too. I think this version does not work on Windows PCs. Keep in mind to install the cmdtool "exiftool", without my script wont work. On Mac you can easily install it with homebrew!

Version 0.1
very basic version of the script for a very special usecase. But I will add some more feature in future versions of the script
